    "Given a weighted and directed graph of V vertices and E edges, Find the shortest distance of all the vertex's from the source vertex S. If a vertices can't be reach from the S then mark the distance as 10^8. Note: If the Graph contains a negative cycle then return an array consisting of only -1.\n",

Your task is to complete the function bellman_ford( ) which takes a number of vertices V and an E-sized list of lists of three integers where the three integers are u,v, and w; denoting there's an edge from u to v, which has a weight of w and source node S as input parameters and returns a list of integers where the ith integer denotes the distance of an ith node from the source node.  \n",
